# Express Project Directory Overview

## 1. `app/`

Core business logic folder, containing the following subdirectories:

- `controllers/`: Handles the specific logic for processing requests.
- `models/`: Defines data structures (e.g., Mongoose models for MongoDB).
- `routes/`: Defines routes and their corresponding controllers.
- `services/`: Encapsulates complex logic (e.g., API calls, database operations).

## 2. `public/`

Stores static files, served using the `express.static` middleware.

Example structure:

```
public/
├── css/
├── js/
├── images/
└── index.html
```

## 3. `views/`

Stores template files for dynamically generating HTML pages (e.g., EJS, Pug).

Example structure:

```
views/
├── index.ejs
├── about.ejs
└── partials/
    ├── header.ejs
    └── footer.ejs
```

## 4. `config/`

Manages environment-related configuration information (e.g., database connections, API keys).

Example files:

```
config/
├── database.js
└── appConfig.js
```

## 5. `middlewares/`

Custom middleware logic, such as authentication, error handling, and request logging.

## 6. `tests/`

Contains test code, using tools like Mocha, Chai, or Jest.

Example structure:

```
tests/
├── controllers/
├── routes/
└── services/
```

## 7. `utils/`

General-purpose utility functions, such as date formatting, logging tools, and encryption utilities.

## 8. `server.js`

The entry point of the project, typically includes:

- Initialization of the Express application.
- Middleware setup.
- Route setup.
- Server startup.
